# NFC Writer

This is a simple NFC Writer library for android.

Just pass your records and let the writer take over.

Look at the sample implementation [MainActivity.java]("nfc-writer%20sample/src/main/java/com/github/tyderion/nfcwriter/sample/MainActivity.java").

To use this library, download the source and import the folder "nfc-writer" as a module in android studio.
then add a module dependany (either via GUI or by adding ```compile project(':nfc-writer')``` to your app dependencies).
